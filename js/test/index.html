            What is Levitra?
            
            Levitra is the brand name of the popular anti erectile dysfunction (ED) drug - Vardenafil. Therefore, the main usage of this medicine is treatment of  men’s sexual impotence symptoms. Moreover, this muscle relaxant is a great blood flow booster. 
            
            Nevertheless, Levitra generic doesn’t protect from sexually transmitted diseases. In other words, you shouldn’t use it as a shield against Syphilis, Gonorrhea, Hepatitis B and HIV. Make some precaution for the safe sex and use condoms,
            
            How does Levitra work?
            
            In order to have the full understanding of how a Levitra tablet works - you should understand the the erection principles. When a man receives a Sexual Stimuli, his brain sends signals to the groin area. As a result, this process facilitates the production of Nitric Oxide (NO). 
            
            NO stimulates an enzyme to making cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP manages contraction of the blood vessels muscles and increases the blood flow to the penis. As a result, a man gets an erection and can have sex.
            
            At the same time, if a man suffer from erectile dysfunction, it means that he can’t get an erection. Henceforth, he can’t satisfy a woman, which may lead to various psychological problems. On the chemical level, ED is caused by the degradative action of phosphodiesterase type 5. Therefore, it causes destruction of cGMP which leads to inability of the penis to get the erection.
            
            Levitra Vardenafil as one of the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5 inhibitors), facilitates a stable production of cGMP. In other words, relaxes muscles and increases blood flow to the penis. As the result, a sexually stimulated man gets an erection.

            When you buy Levitra online UK, you need to understand that it interacts with certain medicaments. In overall, medical experts do not recommend to take erectile dysfunction drugs with the following products:
            
            Angina remedies
            
            These type of remedies usually include nitrates. Therefore, in combination with Vardenafil, these drugs may cause a significant drop in the blood pressure. The most common examples of these drugs:
            
            Nitroglycerin;
            Isosorbide mononitrate;
            Butyl nitrate.
            
             Alpha blockers
            
            Alpha blockers contained in the prostate drugs in mixing with Vardenafil may cause drop in the blood pressure. High blood pressure drugs and other alpha blockers can also cause increase the chance of occurring adverse events. The most common examples of these drugs:
            
            Tamsulosin;
            Terazosin;
            Doxazosin;
            Alfuzosin;
            Prazosin.
            
            HIV drugs
            
            Important to realize that Levitra does not provide protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Moreover, you shouldn’t use it with HIV drugs as this will increase the chance of adverse effects. The most common examples of HIV drugs:
            
            Ritonavir;
            Lopinavir.
            
            Antibiotics
            
            Antibiotics put high pressure on the digestive system including liver and kidneys. Therefore, putting this type of drugs together with Levitra Vardenafil will only increase the pressure on your digestive tract. The most common examples of antibiotics to avoid:
            
            Erythromycin;
            Telithromycin.
            
            The intake of the above mentioned drugs with Vardenafil will certainly increase your blood pressure. On the other hand, there are also antibiotics that will decrease the blood pressure. For instance, Rifampin.
            
            Levitra and other ED drugs
            
            Surely, you need to understand that you do not need to take several ED drugs at once. First, it will increase the chance of the side effects occurring. At the same time, you will just significantly increase the presence of PDE5 inhibitors in your blood. Therefore, you will overdose yourself and put your health at risk. In conclusion, do not mix ED drugs to not get overdosed.
            
            Many patients ask about the comparison between Viagra, Cialis and Levitra and that’s natural to ask. Nevertheless, all these medications are PDE5 inhibitors and all they treat erectile dysfunction. However, Viagra, Levitra and Cialis have some differences.
            
            First of all, the difference is in their core elements:
            
            Viagra - Sildenafil;
            Cialis - Tadalafil;
            Levitra - Vardenafil.
            
            
             Secondly, the time which is needed for activation:
            
            Viagra - 30-60 minutes;
            Cialis - 30 minutes;
            Levitra - 25-60 minutes.
            
            Nevertheless, the above mentioned time periods may vary for one patient to another.
            
             Thirdly, the effect window:
            
            Viagra - 4 hours;
            Cialis - 24-36 hours;
            Levitra - 4-6 hours.
            
            In comparison of what is better Levitra vs Cialis or Levitra vs Viagra, you should understand that is completely individual. Patients may respond differently to the treatment not only different meds, but also to the same meds. That’s how you can even eliminate the question of generic Vardenafil (which is also available) and Levitra.
            
            What about side effects? If you compare Viagra, Cialis, Levitra side effects, you will see that they are pretty similar. Moreover, they have the same precautionary measures.
            
            In conclusion, please, do not mix several ED drugs in one day. Moreover, you need to experience which ED suits you better. For that reason, we recommend you to buy ED trial pack. It’s a good choice for people who is still not sure which drug suits them better.
